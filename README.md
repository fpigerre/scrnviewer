ScrnViewer
==========

ScrnViewer is a light, Visual Basic application to view another computer's screen.

To use the application, open the client.exe file, found in the bin folder on the target's computer.
Enter the IP address of the computer you want to view the screen from, then press connect.
If the connection is successful, press 'Send Screen'.

To view the screen, add the target's IP address or hostname to the start.bat file.
Then open the server.exe file and press 'Start Listening'.
A new window should now pop up showing the target's screen.

To use this application, a VPN may be required.
Using Hamachi is a good solution to this.
If you're trying to see a screen that is on the same network as the viewing computer (eg. At a school or at work), no VPN should be necessary.
